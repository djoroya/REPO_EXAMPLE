# Handwritten Digits Neural Network Demo

This repository contains a small, beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook that trains a simple neural network on scikit-learn's built-in digits dataset.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies (scikit-learn and matplotlib). These are often included in common Python environments. If needed, install them with:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook digits_mlp_demo.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells from top to bottom to load the data, visualize sample digits, train the model, and view predictions.
